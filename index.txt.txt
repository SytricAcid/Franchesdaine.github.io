<h1> "The Midnight Deadline" </h1>
<p class="one"> <b> 
Mia and Lila, best friends and chronic procrastinators, ignored their project deadlines until the final night. <br>
Meeting at Mia’s house, they surrounded themselves with snacks and crumpled notes, determined to finish everything in one night. <br>
As the clock ticked closer to midnight, their fingers flew across the keyboard, fueled by caffeine and panic. <br>

</p>
<p class="two"> 
By 12:00 AM, the girls were completely drained, stress and exhaustion taking over. <br>
Just as the clock struck, they both froze, falling silent at their desks. <br>
The next morning, their bodies were found, faces illuminated by their still-glowing screens. <br>
It’s said that ever since, ghostly typing sounds echo from Mia’s room at midnight, haunting procrastinators everywhere.
